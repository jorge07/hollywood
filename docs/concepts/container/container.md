# The container

Coming from other ecosystems like Java and PHP, I really miss my previous workflows and productivity.
Specially when dealing with tests suites in nodejs, singletons and mocks. 

Dependency Injection it's the main miss in the nodejs for me and I've tried to not reinvent the wheel, and I've used [Inversify](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS).
I'm not a big fan of annotations, but it's the price to pay.

If you want to learn about the tool or DI in general, the documentation is good enough.
